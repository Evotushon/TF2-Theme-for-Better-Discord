                                                           Description
This theme was made to reproduce the ConTracker, the device in TF2 that is made to accept contracts, mini quests that are made to make you get certain weapons.
To reproduce even the Developer Console, that looks like any other device in TF2, use compact text mode.

Credits go to limeshark.dev for their program of edit for BetterDiscord Themes
